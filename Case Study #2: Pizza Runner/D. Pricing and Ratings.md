# üçï Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## D. Pricing and Ratings

### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

```sql

SELECT CASE 
		   WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 'Meat Lovers'
		   ELSE 'Vegetarian' 
		   END as pizzz_name,
	   CASE 
		   WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN COUNT(c.pizza_id) * 12
		   ELSE COUNT(c.pizza_id) * 10
		   END as total_money
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r 
ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.pizza_id
```

### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
Add cheese is $1 extra

```sql

WITH extra_orders as 
(
	SELECT 
	       CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 'Meat Lovers'
		   ELSE 'Vegetarian'
		   END as pizza_name,
		   SUM(LEN([pizza_runner].[getNumerivalue](extras))) as extra_charge
	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
	WHERE extras IS NOT NULL AND 
	      order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id 
		                   FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
						   WHERE cancellation IS NOT NULL)
	GROUP BY pizza_id
), orders_runners as 
(
	SELECT CASE 
		   WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 'Meat Lovers'
		   ELSE 'Vegetarian' 
		   END as pizzz_name,
	   CASE 
		   WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN COUNT(c.pizza_id) * 12
		   ELSE COUNT(c.pizza_id) * 10
		   END as total_money
	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r 
	ON c.order_id = r.order_id
	WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
	GROUP BY c.pizza_id
)

SELECT  e.pizza_name,
        e.extra_charge + o.total_money as total_money
FROM extra_orders e
JOIN orders_runners o 
ON o.pizzz_name = e.pizza_name

```

### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```sql
-- create rating table 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_runner.rating;
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.rating
(
	order_id	INT,
	customer_id INT,
	runner_id	INT,
	rating		INT,
	comment		VARCHAR(MAX)
)
```

----

### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
  customer_id
  order_id
  runner_id
  rating
  order_time
  pickup_time
  Time between order and pickup
  Delivery duration
  Average speed
  Total number of pizzas


```sql

SELECT c.customer_id,
	   c.order_id,
	   r.runner_id,
	   t.rating,
	   c.order_time,
	   r.pickup_time,
	   DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) as time_diff,
	   r.duration,
	   CAST((distance * 1.0/(duration *1.0 /60))AS NUMERIC(10,2)) as avg_speed,
	   COUNT(c.pizza_id) as total_pizzas

FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r 
ON c.order_id = r.order_id
JOIN pizza_runner.rating t 
ON t.order_id = c.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id,
	     c.order_id,
	     r.runner_id,
	     t.rating,
	     c.order_time,
	     r.pickup_time,
	     r.duration,
		 r.distance
ORDER BY c.customer_id, c.order_id;

```

### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```sql
DECLARE @total_pizza_cost INT;
SET @total_pizza_cost = 138;

SELECT ROUND(@total_pizza_cost - SUM(duration)*0.30, 0) as total_money
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```
